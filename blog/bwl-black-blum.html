          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">

              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable and impact-driven alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place to live. </p>

              <p><a href="https://black-blum.com/" target="_blank">Black+Blum</a> is a design-led company that creates innovative, sustainable products for the home and office.

              <p>Their products are designed to help people live a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle, with a focus on reducing waste and single-use plastics.

              <p>We caught up with Amelia Fetherstonhaugh, Digital Marketing Manager, to discuss their journey and the future.

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Black+Blum exist?</p>

              <p>"To create products which help our customers lead a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.
              <p>Our objective is to reduce the need and reliance on single/short-use plastics and packaging by providing high-quality and innovative reusable alternatives that look beautiful and function perfectly."

                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Black+Blum has a strong commitment to sustainability and creating products that help people reduce waste and live a more eco-friendly lifestyle. </figcaption>
                </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">How did Black+Blum start?</p>

              <p>"Dan Black and Martin Blum met while studying industrial design at Northumbria University. In 1998 they formed Black+Blum and based it in London, one of the most diverse and creative cities in the world.

              <p>The business started as a design consultancy creating products for other companies, but our passion lay in developing and selling our own designs. We launched our first range (lighting) in 2000 and over the next ten years we expanded into other homeware products, which quickly became iconic best sellers and global design competition winners.

              <p>In 2010, we launched our first lunch box ‚ÄòBox Appetit‚Äô. It took inspiration from Japan, a country that had developed the designs of Bento lunch boxes into an art form. At the time, the West was making do with boring, waxy plastic food containers. ‚ÄòBox Appetit‚Äô was the first adult lunch box that catered for Western cuisine and presented food beautifully - greatly improving the user's eating experience. This was swiftly followed by our ‚ÄòLunch Pot‚Äô and ‚ÄòBento Box‚Äô.

              <p>In 2011, we took further inspiration from Japan, and introduced our first filter water bottle ‚ÄòEau Good‚Äô. The filtration power of active charcoal has been used by the Japanese for centuries, so we leveraged this idea into a bottle that both reduced single-use plastic and made tap water taste great. It was an instant hit and has become iconic for the brand."</p>

              <p class="h6">How it ties in with sustainability</p>

              <p>"Taking your own food and drink on-the-go helps reduce food waste and single-use packaging. Whether it is taking your lunch to work, having a takeaway coffee with a reusable cup, or going on a day hike and taking a picnic from home, all of our designs help make it easier and more enjoyable to bring food and drink with you, where ever you want to go. ""

                <p class="h6">Why are they doing what they‚Äôre doing?</p>

                <p>"As designers, you become acutely aware of a products purpose, and whether or not it‚Äôs something that is necessary. There‚Äôs so much stuff in the world, and every day this pile of stuff is growing bigger. We wanted to make sure that every product we release represents a solution to a real need, and has a place in the world. It‚Äôs not a great business model, but our ethos is buy once, buy well. We want our products to be used every day, and they‚Äôre made to last a lifetime.""

                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Black+Blum excels at creating innovative and functional products that are also aesthetically pleasing. They have a unique design perspective that combines form and function to create products that are not only practical but also beautiful.</figcaption>
                </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What does Black+Blum do best?</p>

              <p>"Many companies in our sector take existing products off the shelf in a warehouse and simply add their logo. At Black+Blum, all of our designs are unique to us and designed by our in-house team in our London studio.

              <p>We make products which are truly functional and designed to be used every day, without any superfluous features. We only work with super high-quality materials that are built to last and age well.

              <p>We also have an excellent aftercare service and sell replacement parts for nearly all our products, that way when a lid or a fork goes missing, or a seal needs to be replaced, our customers don‚Äôt need to buy the entire product again. Our product designers are always on hand to help customer service answer queries from customers or to explain the best way to care for a product (to be honest, any excuse to talk about their products, and they‚Äôre there).""

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the trends in your market space?</p>

              <p>"There are many companies in our space who are fashion led and rely on colour and pattern to give their designs appeal.
              <p>We actively go against this as want to ensure our products are timeless. We achieve this with a modern (almost ‚ÄòBauhaus‚Äô) minimal utilitarian aesthetic‚Ä¶ the sort of design that can become an ‚Äòantique‚Äô of the future and still have appeal in years to come (even with scratches and dents). We are starting to see other companies follow us on this approach, so perhaps we are the trend setters on this approach.""

              <p class="h5">What's next for Black+Blum and what should people get excited for?</p>

                <p>"We are always working on new designs but don‚Äôt want to give too much away. We are working on more soft goods (bags) and products for the Outdoor market.""

                <div class="text-center my-6">
                  <img class="rounded-md" src="../assets/img/blog/images/bwl-blackblum-04.jpg" alt="...">
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Overall, Black+Blum is best known for their combination of innovative design, functionality, and sustainability.</figcaption>
                </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the challenges of starting a sustainability journey for a business such as Black+Blum?</p>

              <p>"It is very complex and difficult to measure emissions for lots of different materials, being made in many different locations. This is especially hard when you‚Äôre a small business and use a lot of different suppliers as well, so you‚Äôre relying on emission measurement processes you have little control over. "

              <p>Black+Blum takes an active role in minimising the carbon impact of products. While understanding that they use carbon intensive materials like stainless steel, all Black+Blum products are built to last. As Amelia tells us: "In the design department of Black+Blum we always talk about the word ‚Äòsoul‚Äô. A product develops ‚Äòsoul‚Äô when it becomes a cherished item to the owner. We live in a society where too often people buy cheap products which do not last and often end up as landfill."

              <p>Some of the things the company already does are ensuring production factories are regularly 3rd party audited to comply with standardised working conditions and environmental regulations, and only ever using marine freight (never air freight).

              <p>"It‚Äôs definitely important to audit all business processes and identify where changes can be made in order to function more sustainably. For example, we‚Äôre 1% for the Planet members, which commits us to donating 1% of annuals sales to environmental charities. All of our packaging is fully recyclable (you can even add it to your home compost). But most importantly, the durability of our designs means we want our products to last for years to come, and not end up in landfill."
