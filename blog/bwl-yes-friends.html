          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">

              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable and impact-driven alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place to live. </p>

              <p><a href="https://yesfriends.co/" target="_blank">Yes Friends</a> has created a line of T-shirts that are not only affordable but also ethical, using 90% less carbon than traditional T-shirts.

              <p>The company's mission is to produce the softest T-shirts possible while also maintaining the most ethical supply chain.

              <p>We caught up with Sam Mabley, Founder of Yes Friends, to discuss how they are changing the world of affordable ethical t-shirts!

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Yes Friends exist?</p>

              <p>Yes Friends have been going for about a year and a half.

              <p>‚ÄúWe launched with the ‚Äú¬£7.99 Sustainable ethical T-shirt‚Äù, and sold about 4000 in our first month and that was the start!‚Äù Sam told us.

              <p>Their T-shirts are manufactured using 90% less CO2 than traditional T-shirts. Additionally, Yes Friends employs organic cotton and partners with solar-powered factories to produce their renowned T-shirts.

              <p>Their goal is to utilise sustainable materials while ensuring the best possible sustainability practices during production. For example, their production facility recently installed a new water treatment plant capable of recycling up to 100% of production water.

                <div class="text-center my-6">
                  <img class="rounded-md" src="../assets/img/blog/images/bwl-yesfriends-01.jpeg" alt="...">
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Yes Friends' signature product is their sustainable and ethically sourced T-shirt, which is made from organic cotton and uses 90% less carbon in production than traditional T-shirts.</figcaption>
                </div>


              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What does Yes Friends do best?</p>

              <p>First, its the suppliers they work with. Their focus on ethical practices begins with their suppliers, as they exclusively collaborate with third-party certified suppliers who prioritise ethical standards such as Fairtrade.

              <p>Secondly, it's the customer base. Yes Friends attracts two types of shoppers: the first being the classic shopper who seeks affordable T-shirts, while the second is the ethical shopper who becomes a brand advocate.

              <p>Ethical shoppers are considered "warm-conscious shoppers" who strive to purchase sustainable clothing options that positively impact the environment. They appreciate the concept of sustainable shopping.

              <p>Previously, their outlook was that sustainable brands were unattainable due to their high price points. However, Yes Friends offers sustainably sourced T-shirts at an affordable cost.

              <p>As Sam explains, "I can now purchase a T-shirt at the same price as Zara, but with the knowledge that it is ethically sourced."

              <div class="text-center my-6">
                <img class="rounded-md" src="../assets/img/blog/images/bwl-yesfriends-02.jpeg" alt="...">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> The company offers their T-shirts at an affordable price point while maintaining ethical and sustainable practices throughout their supply chain.</figcaption>
              </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the market trends in the sustainable T-Shirt space?</p>

              <p>The three biggest trends are:
                <ol>
                  <li>the fabrics used in the production of the clothes, </li>
                  <li>affordability,</li>
                  <li>interesting design</li>
                </ol>

              <p class="h6">Fabrics</p>

              <p>The choice of fabric is crucial, as there is a growing demand for organic cotton and recycled polyester in the market. These are the two most commonly used fabrics.

              <p>Efforts are being made to minimize water usage and eliminate harmful chemicals during the production of these fabrics. This is particularly critical in the case of heavy production cycles such as denim, which requires a significant amount of water and chemicals to create the finished product.

              <p class="h6">Affordability</p>

              <p>Additionally, affordability plays a critical role. According to a Deloitte consumer study, affordability is the most significant obstacle for ethical brands. Yes Friends aims to address this concern by targeting this type of consumer.

                <p class="h6">Design</p>

                <p>Finally, there is a shortage of well-designed ethical clothing options. Sam notes, "When you visit the high street, you can easily find clothing for any occasion at an affordable price. However, if you are seeking ethically produced clothing, it can be challenging or costly to find something suitable."

              <p>Yes Friends has already addressed the issues of fabric and affordability in producing "basics," and they are now expanding their focus to include the design of their shirts.

                  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Organic cotton is better for the environment because it is grown without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other harmful chemicals that can pollute the soil, water, and air.</figcaption>
                </div>



              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What new initiatives are on the horizon?</p>

              <p>The next major objective for Yes Friends is to introduce new designs. They aim to offer a wider variety of colors while maintaining an affordable price point. Moreover, they continue to explore ways to further enhance their fabrics. Interestingly, many customers prioritize finding the softest T-shirt available.

              <p>As a result, Yes Friends is determined to produce the softest, most affordable, and ethically sourced low-carbon T-shirt on the market.

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the challenges of starting a sustainability journey for a business such as Yes Friends?</p>

              <p>Being a new entrant in the market, finding the time resource required to measure their own footprint has been the main obstacle.

              <p>Recognizing that assessing every aspect of their supply chain would be a daunting undertaking, it is crucial to determine the complete impact of their supply chain to identify areas that require improvement and enhance their efficiency.
