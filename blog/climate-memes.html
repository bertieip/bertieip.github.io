              <p class="h5">As temperatures soar across the UK and Europe, we‚Äôre starting to see the direct impact of climate change, and it‚Äôs come decades sooner than expected.

              <p> Climate pledges are targeting net-zero by 2050 but it's becoming increasingly apparent that we need to attempt to reach these by 2030 at the latest if we want to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
              <p>Despite some governments, organisations and people taking a stand and making real progress, it all too often seems that the overall progress is nowhere near fast enough.
              <p>Recently, we came across this meme that really sums up what we‚Äôve all been feeling for the past few weeks, and how the scale of change is so easily dismissed by the media, politicians and other behaviours. </p>

              <div class="text-center my-6">

              <P>As a follow up to this, we‚Äôve put together a list of some of the most famous climate crisis related memes from the past decade that sum up a lot of this inaction.

                <p>These memes equally demonstrate the dichotomy that is the severity of the situation and how its not being taken anywhere near seriously enough.

                  <p>If these resonate with you, then it might be time for more action. Here we go.



              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Condescending Wonka.</p>

              <p>The original image comes from a scene in the 1971 musical Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. In 2011 the ‚ÄòCondescending Wonka‚Äô <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/condescending-wonka-creepy-wonka" target="_blank">meme</a> spread everywhere and remains a staple in meme history. </p>

              <p>Perhaps we should start listening to scientists and other organisations without agenda about the danger we‚Äôre in? </p>
              <p>Ant√≥nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/humanity-faces-collective-suicide-over-climate-crisis-warns-un-chief" target="_blank">told</a> ministers from 40 countries meeting to discuss the climate crisis on Monday: <i>‚ÄúHalf of humanity is in the danger zone, from floods, droughts, extreme storms and wildfires. No nation is immune. Yet we continue to feed our fossil fuel addiction. We have a choice. Collective action or collective suicide. It is in our hands.‚Äù</i>

              <p class="h5">This is Fine.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the most pertinent meme considering the current situation we‚Äôre in right now. The UK‚Äôs infrastructure is shutting down because of the heat, with reduced train services, schools closing, and ambulance services being rationed, and yet there seems to be very little panic to the actual the gravity of the situation. </p>

              <p>The ‚ÄòThis is Fine‚Äô <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine" target="_blank">meme</a> originally comes from K.C. Green's Gunshow 2013 comic #648 and was shared on Reddit as a meme in 2014.

              <p>I wonder how big the flames need to get before there‚Äôs a more appropriate reaction?</p>

              </div>

              <p class="h5">Drakeposting.</p>

              <p>This <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/drakeposting" target="_blank">meme</a> comes from the music video of Drake's 2015 hit R&B single "Hotline Bling", part of the Drakeposting movement. </p>

              <p>Remarkably, during the recent Conservative leader debates, we‚Äôve had politicians use climate change and UK net-zero targets as a bargaining and polling tool, with one candidate actually announcing that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/15/tory-tv-debate-key-points-trans-rights-net-zero-and-boris-johnsons-honesty-17010110/" target="_blank">they would not</a> commit to the current net-zero pledge. </p>

              <p>It‚Äôs 2022 - we hoped that this wouldn‚Äôt be up for debate anymore.</p>

              <p class="h5">SpongeBob Burning Paper.</p>

              <p>The ‚ÄòSpongeBob Burning Paper‚Äô <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spongebob-burning-paper" target="_blank">meme</a> was originally taken from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Party Pooper Pants," which aired May 17th, 2002. </p>

              <p>It is often used to joke about unwanted truths, of which there seem to be many when it comes to the climate crisis. Trump features again here, but insert any politician that fits the bill - there are plenty of them. </p>

              <p>Did you know that you can see the voting record for all politicians on <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/" target="_blank">TheyWorkForYou.com/</a>? Find a politician, find out what they voted for in the past, and then decide whether you think they‚Äôre a fit candidate to tackle the greatest challenge in human history. </p>

              <p class="h5">Distracted Boyfriend.</p>

              <p>Possibly one of my favourite memes as the versatility lends itself to almost any situation, but especially when it comes to the climate crisis. </p>

              <p>I urge you to check out <a href="https://www.spellingmistakescostlives.com/burnthefuture" target"_blank">Darren Cullen‚Äôs</a> Burn The Future exhibition where he explores what this meme is all about in much more detail. ‚ÄúNet-zero‚Äù means a little less when you‚Äôve been complicit in covering up evidence for climate science for the past 40 years, right?</p>

              <p>On November 2nd 2015, photographer Antonio Guillem posted this photo on the stock photo database iStock <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/distracted-boyfriend" target="_blank">meme</a>. The image became an instant classic, known as the ‚ÄòDistracted Boyfriend‚Äô meme. Obviously, we had to include it. </p>

              <p class="h5">Gru's Plan.</p>

              <p>On July 9th, 2010 Despicable Me was released. The main character, Gru presents a plan to steal the moon, and discovers a drawing of himself sitting on the toilet hidden within the presentation. The screen-grab became a superior <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grus-plan" target="_blank">meme</a> in 2018.</p>

              <p class="h5">Lizzo's Tiny Purse.</p>

              <p>In November 2019, Lizzo brought a minuscule purse to the 47th annual American Music Awards. Several days later, ENews shared a picture of Lizzo and her tiny purse on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lizzos-tiny-purse" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. We think this meme perfectly reflects the outrageous corporate greenwashing taking place at the moment.

              <p>Make sure to check out the brands you like before buying them - you might be shocked at what you‚Äôre supporting when you look into it.</p>

              <p>Some brands are doing amazing things, though, and you should support them if you can. We spoke to Neem London a while back, and we love what they‚Äôre doing. You can read the full interview <a href="https://alectro.io/blog/neem-london.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

              </div>

              <p class="h5">"Be A Lot Cooler If You Did" </p>

              <p>To finish us off, we‚Äôve got the evergreen Matthew McConaughey, with an iconic quote that nicely sums up how we all feel. </p>

              <p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/be-a-lot-cooler-if-you-did" target= "_blank">"Be A Lot Cooler If You Did"</a> is a memorable quote spoken by Matthew McConaughey from the 1993 movie Dazed and Confused. </p>

              <p>The double entendre of the meme might make this the best climate memes out there, what do you think? That being said, considering the record of most politicians, you might need to explain it to them.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p>There is almost no end to the memes that could go some way to explaining the situation we‚Äôre in currently, but beyond that, there is a serious message behind all of this.</p>

              <p>Today is the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62217282" target="_blank"> 19th July 2022</a>, and the UK is set to see its hottest day on record, with temperatures expected to reach up to 42C. The Met Office has issued a red extreme heat warning covering much of central, northern, and south-east England. </p>

              <p>On Monday, when temperatures were at 38C, there was no end to the chaos:

              <ul>
                <li>At least four people are believed to have drowned after attempting to escape the heat in rivers and lakes.</li>
                <li>Network Rail has issued a "do not travel" warning for Tuesday affecting services travelling through the "red zone" of the Met Office's weather warning.</li>
                <li>The extreme warning, indicating a threat to life, is in place in an area stretching between London, Manchester and York.</li>
                <li>Monday saw a number of schools close, and water companies in southern and eastern England have warned increased demand is leading to low pressure - and even interrupted supply - for some households.</li>
                <li>Flights into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire stopped after part of the runway melted, and Luton Airport also suspended flights due to runway issues. </li>
              </ul>

              <p>The list goes on and on and on..

                <p>Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change.

                  <p>The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world implement policies to ensure emissions are dramtically reduced.

                    <p>We don‚Äôt have time to waste, we must act now. Demand more from your politicians. Speak to your friends and family. And make your voice heard.

                      <p>Remember, this is only the hottest summer of your life <i>so far</i>.</p>
