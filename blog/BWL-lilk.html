          </div>


          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">

              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place.</p>

              <p><a href="https://upcirclebeauty.com/" target="_blank">Lilk</a> is on a mission to prove that its blended milk alternatives are better tasting and better for the environment than traditional cow‚Äôs milk. Through experimenting with many different ingredients, the company has been able to create ‚ÄòThe Lush Blend‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Common Blend‚Äô formulas which produces an average of 30% less carbon than the alternative milk market leader.</p>

              <p>Lilk has created its products to be all-purpose, meaning that they can be used in a variety of ways as their consistency mimics milk very well. Whether you want to have a coffee or add some depth to your cooking, Lilk has got you covered with its natural milk alternatives.</p>

              <p>Charlotte Khushi, Chief Creative Officer of Lilk, shared some great insights into how the company is transforming the alternative milk industry.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Lilk exist?</p>

              <p>The global milk alternatives market was estimated to be valued at $22.25 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to over $60 billion by <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/dairy-alternatives-market-100221" target="_blank">2030.</a></p>

              <p>Currently, in the market, there aren‚Äôt many blended milk alternatives. Therefore, Lilk decided to create its own range of blends which they describe as ‚Äútypically richer, more balanced and more delicious than traditional one-ingredient alternatives such as oat or soy milk‚Äù.</p>

              <p>‚ÄúFrom the co-founders‚Äô perspectives, we found that there were many valid reasons for creating Lilk. Animal welfare, dietary restrictions and the climate were big drivers for us.</p>

              <p>We tried many alternative milks on the market and none of them really hit the spot for us. I personally missed a proper cup of tea with a good alternative milk. So we started experimenting with different ingredients to create our own blend and it‚Äôs led us here.‚Äù</p>

              <p class="h5">What key things does Lilk do best?</p>

              <h6>The production side</h6>

              <p>Lilk has measured the carbon footprint (a.k.a. foodprint) of its whole production cycle for its products ‚Äúfrom cradle to store‚Äù meaning from the moment ingredients are picked to when they are transported to supermarkets. The results obtained showed that Lilk‚Äôs products have very low carbon intensity. This is because the company is using ingredients mainly from the UK and Europe, and the final product is being manufactured in Somerset, meaning that there are far fewer transportation emissions involved in the process. As a result, the company learnt that it takes approximately 0.3 kg of CO2 to create a carton of Lilk, in comparison to 3.15kg for a litre of cow's milk.</p>

              <p>Lilk is looking to start its B-corp certification journey in the near future which is exciting for the company, as B-Corp status will allow them to appeal to further customers and future employees. </p>

              <h6>The packaging</h6>

              <p>The entire pack is fully recyclable, made from FSC-certified paperboard, and provides the best CO2 performance compared to other types of beverage packaging. </p>

              <p class="h5">What are the challenges of starting a sustainability journey for a business such as UpCircle?</p>

              <p>Whilst small businesses have to deal with many challenges as they begin their journeys, environmental programmes can be difficult to start early because of the time resources and costs associated.</p>

              <p>At Alectro, we want to make sure that businesses aren‚Äôt overwhelmed by the sheer amount which goes into starting their sustainability journey. We provide an end-to-end service to support companies at each stage during their measurement, reduction and offsetting of their carbon emissions. This reduces the time and cost associated with kickstarting a sustainability journey and helps to make the overall process as straightforward as possible so the company can continue with the rest of its growth.</p>

              <p>Whether a company wants to reach carbon neutrality, net zero or become a B-corp we are here to help. We‚Äôre also partnered with the UNFCCC's Climate Neutral Now to give businesses the confidence that your work will be validated at the highest level.</p>


            <hr class="w-100">
