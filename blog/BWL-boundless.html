            <h2>Brands We Love: Boundless Snacks</h2>
            <p>4th November, 2022</p>
          </div>


          <div class="text-center my-8">
            <img class="rounded-md" src="../assets/img/blog/BWL_boundless.png" alt="...">
          </div>


          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">

              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place.</p>

              <p>Boundless Activated Snacks makes chips, nuts and seeds which taste good and do good.</p>

              <p>Boundless wants to look after the health of its customers and the planet. They do this by bridging the gap between gut health and feeling happy, and also sourcing all of its grains from the UK, promoting sustainability. </p>

              <p>We met with Cathy Moseley, founder of Boundless, to discuss how they‚Äôre changing the world of healthy snacks.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Boundless exist?</p>

              <p>Boundless recognises that gut health is vital for everybody's mental and physical well-being. Cathy stated that ‚Äúit can even be recognised as our second brain‚Äù. This is why it has created its range of activated snacks, to help the public look after their health and protect the planet at the same time.</p>

              <p>The trend of healthy eating is also reflected by the fact that the global snack market is projected to grow to $260.88 billion by 2025 with healthy snacks leading demand.</p>

              <p>From a mental perspective, snacking can evoke enjoyment and positive emotional feelings because we are fuelling our bodies outside of usual meal times.</p>

              <p>‚ÄúWe can bridge the gap between making snacking much more functional and more beneficial. Rather than something we eat that fills you up for a bit and doesn't do anything else for the body.‚Äù‚Äù</p>

              <p>Cathy expressed that Boundless is making sure that it has a purpose-led mission towards sustainability.</p>

              <div class="text-center my-6">

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Boundless Activated Snacks Nuts and Seeds Product</figcaption>
              </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What key things does Boundless do best?</p>

              <h6>Healthy products</h6>

              <p>Boundless uses activation to create its products, a method which involves soaking nuts and seeds in water. This process reduces levels of phytic acid which causes a bitter taste, whilst also increasing the bioavailability of nutrients and the nutritional value of grains.</p>

              <h6>Packaging</h6>

              <p>Currently Boundless is using 100% recyclable packaging. In the snacking world, this can be very difficult as more eco-friendly packaging means that snacks can often have a shorter shelf life compared to non-environmentally friendly packaging, such as plastics.

              <p>At the same time, it wants to integrate new technologies which could improve its products and materials.</p>

              <h6>Ethos</h6>

              <p>Honesty: being truthful to their customers, their work and their team who are all treated equally. Natural: making all products from natural ingredients using a natural process. Authenticity: staying true to their brand and what they stand for which is to make people aware of healthy snack alternatives.

                <h6>Charity work</h6>

                <p>Boundless work with <a href="https://www.frankwater.com/" target="_blank">Frank Water</a>, a Bristol-based water charity. A penny of each packet that Boundless sells assists Frank Water to help their cause.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúWater is used a lot in the way we produce our products because we soak nuts, seeds and grains to achieve activation. With access to water being one of the most depleting factors in the world, it's really important as a brand to work closely with charities that secure water access. This is a great way to help people in need to ensure that they have sustainable, clean and sanitised drinking water.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Boundless also works very closely with <a href="https://www.givehelpshare.org.uk/" target="_blank">Give. Help. Share.</a> by donating their snacks to people in need.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIt puts a lot of pressure within many homes for parents to try and find money to buy food in the school holidays to feed their kids. Give. Help. Share. provides food for kids in times when free school meals are not available. We want to make sure that we're able to give nutritious food to those in difficult positions.‚Äù</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the trends in the healthy snacking industry?</p>

              <p>Cathy sees three main trends in the industry:</p>


              <ol>
              <li>Benefits of healthy snacks: ‚ÄúThere needs to be more education around healthy snacking  I do think there is only so much small brands can do.‚Äù.</li>
              <li>Mindfulness, consideration and leading the way in change: ‚ÄúAs a challenger and start-up brand, we have to lead the way on change and sustainability. There's much more mindfulness and consideration towards the environment in our industry.‚Äù</li>
              <li>Difficulties and self-preservation: ‚ÄúThe difficulty lies within the next 18 months and the cost of living crisis. What is happening within our industry is higher logistical-, manufacturing-, core commodity-, employment-, and government insurance-costs which combined are big issues for smaller companies.‚Äù</li>
            </ol>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What‚Äôs next for Boundless and what new initiatives should we get excited about?</p>

              <p>Boundless are continuously on its journey to educate consumers on healthy snacking whilst also ensuring that its products become more sustainable. </p>

              <p> Boundless aims to do this through three key areas:</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Switching to paper packaging that is fully compostable for all their products.</li>
              <li>Continue working with their charity partners.</li>
              <li>Expanding its range, with new flavours.</li>
            </ul>


            <hr class="w-100">
