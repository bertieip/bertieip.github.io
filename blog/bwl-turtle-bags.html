              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable and impact-driven alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place to live. </p>

              <p><a href="https://www.turtle-bags.com/" target="_blank">Turtle Bags </a> is on a mission to raise awareness surrounding the amount of plastic waste in the ocean which is extremely harmful to aquatic life.

              <p>They also work closely with charities such as the <a href="https://www.mcsuk.org/" target="_blank">Marine Conservation Society</a> to help maintain marine biodiversity and prevent ocean pollution and climate change.

              <p>We caught up with Beth Williams, Founder of Turtle Bags, to discuss how they are changing the world of textiles in the hopes of reducing marine plastics.


              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Turtle Bags exist?</p>

              <p>‚ÄúTurtle bags was set up 20 years ago to raise awareness about marine plastics.‚Äù

              <p><a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/marine-plastic-pollution#:~:text=At%20least%2014%20million%20tons,causes%20severe%20injuries%20and%20death." target="_blank">Over 14 million tons of plastic waste is released into the ocean each year</a> which makes up 80% of the debris found in marine environments. This form of pollution threatens marine ecosystems, our food safety, human health, and leads to climate change. Most marine species will ingest plastic over their lifetimes or can end up entangled in plastic waste, which can eventually cause severe injuries and death.

              <p>‚ÄúI'm an ecologist and I knew that not only plastic was getting out into the seas in a way that it shouldn't, but also beginning to move through the food chain and harming marine biodiversity.

              <p>My mission was to set up a business that would raise awareness about marine plastics and offer an alternative to plastic everyday essentials which is sustainably and ethically sourced.‚Äù

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Turtle Bags have a range of reusable products which are made to be versatile and last for a long time.</figcaption>
              </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the key things Turtle Bags does best?</p>

              <h6>Small company with a big voice</h6>

              <p>It is a devastating fact that over half of the 300 million tonnes of plastic produced each year makes single-use products such as shopping bags, cups and straws. Therefore, Turtle Bags wants to raise awareness by providing alternative reusable products which can be used in a variety of ways. The company offers a range of reusable bags that can hold up to 40kg of cargo. The bags can be used as grocery, produce, and string bags.

              <h6>Suppliers</h6>

              <p>‚ÄúOur hero product would be the cotton string bag, and that's made from organic and fair trade cotton. We take care in looking at our suppliers to make sure they align with our company and sustainability. For example, we also work with a women's empowerment group in Bangladesh and they work hard to make sure that the jute that they produce is sustainable. It's grown effectively in the regional climate there as there's a high water table."

              <p>Additionally, Beth states that their suppliers are members of the World Fair Trade Organisation. ‚ÄúThey do a wonderful job in supporting vulnerable women across Bangladesh, in rural and in urban areas.‚Äù

              <h6>Charity</h6>

              <p>Turtle Bags works closely with the <a href="https://www.mcsuk.org/" target="_blank">Marine Conservation Society</a> and has a long-standing partnership with the charity donating 10% of its profits to them. The charity works to help raise awareness for marine life and how people can contribute to prevent ocean pollution and climate change.

              <hr class="w-100">


              <p class="h5">What's up next for Turtle Bags and what should we get excited about?</p>

              <p>"We're looking to expand the range even further - we want to make new products such as shopping trolleys made out of the same type of cotton."

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the challenges of starting a sustainability journey for a business such as Turtle Bags?</p>

              <p>‚ÄúOne of the main challenges of starting a sustainability journey is that it involves a lot of change. Especially at the movement with the way of the world, it is not easy with everything else going on there are a lot of challenges businesses need to overcome.<p>

              <p>The overall tip to other companies: Don‚Äôt take any shortcut!"</p>


            <hr class="w-100">
