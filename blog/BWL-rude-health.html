          </div>


          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">

              <p class="h5">At Alectro, we‚Äôre constantly on the lookout for sustainable alternatives to everyday items. This is an opportunity to share the brands that we love and that are making the world a greener place.</p>

              <p><a href="https://rudehealth.com/pages/sustainability" target="_blank">Rude Health</a> is a food and dairy-free drinks company most well-known for its Almond Drinks. The company aims to make healthy consumption a celebration rather than a sacrifice for taste and costs.</p>

              <p>We caught up with Camilla Barnard, Co-founder and Brand Director of Rude Health, to discuss how they‚Äôre changing the world of healthy foods and drinks.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Why does Rude Health exist?</p>

              <p>Originally the company started 17 years ago making muesli. Over time, Camilla describes that they had a ‚Äúnatural extension‚Äù from foods to drinks as Rude Health‚Äôs dairy-free drinks paired up with their food products.</p>

              <p>‚ÄúThe idea for our products is to make them as close as possible to what you might make at home. To allow the ingredient's original flavours to be the elements which come out without messing around with ingredients and putting unnatural stabilisers or thickeners in.‚Äù</p>

              <p>Rude Health is on a mission to make healthy food and drink alternatives taste better. ‚ÄúWhat we are trying to do is look at sustainability from a holistic viewpoint. From the human body, helping people eat well and look after themselves, to looking after the planet. So we're really aiming to be an all-in-one sustainable company.‚Äù</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Rude Health team have been making healthy eating a celebration for nearly two decades.</figcaption>
              </div>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What does Rude Health do best?</p>

              <h6>B-corp certification</h6>

              <p>Rude health has been B Corp certified since June 2021. They have worked towards obtaining a great environment score meaning that the company‚Äôs customers and employees will know that it is truly committed to creating real environmental, societal and other benefits.</p>

              <h6>Healthy eating with no compromises</h6>

              <p>‚ÄúWe wanted to really raise the game in the alternative milk industry to make them as delicious as we possibly can. This is why right from the beginning, we wanted to choose the best ingredients. </p>

              <p>For example, in our almond milk, we chose Sicilian almonds rather than those from California. And at the time most people purchased almonds from California, but nobody knew of any of the problems occurring in California such as drought and disrupting bee biodiversity.</p>

              <p>We found a good family farm in Sicily which takes action to be as sustainable as they can, producing almonds without the need for fertilisers and staying bee friendly. Also because of this, the almonds are imported to the UK from a closer location than the US."</p>

                <h6>Charity Work</h6>

                <p>‚ÄúWe give 5% of profits to charity, these are mostly food-related charities. We've done a lot of work with getting chefs into schools to make sure children have access to healthy food.</p>

              <p>We support <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/">FareShare</a>, which is a fantastic way of making sure the food doesn't get wasted as it is distributed to those who need it most. And we also support <a href="https://thefelixproject.org/">The Felix Project</a> which is a local charity that holds dinners for people and it's done in a way that makes food have a second life, rather than feeling like you're getting leftovers.‚Äù</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Felix project is fighting a great cause aiming to make sure that ‚Äúno one goes hungry and good food is never wasted‚Äù</figcaption>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What's up next for Rude Health during its sustainability journey?</p>

              <p>The company have already reached many milestones including making sure its packaging is bio-packed (this means they're 88% made from recycled materials such as sugar cane waste).</p>

              <p>Rude Health has also reduced the number of trucks that it uses, and it's now using containers on trains. This logistic improvement has helped save 64% of transport CO2 emissions.</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Rude Health is working on reducing its environmental impact by using drink cartons made from sugar canes that are 100% recyclable.</figcaption>
              </div>

                <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What are the challenges of starting a sustainability journey for a business such as Rude Health?</p>

              <p>‚ÄúThe usual challenges stem from the point that starting a sustainability journey can be costly and time-consuming, which becomes a barrier because nobody has much capacity outside their usual day-job. </p>

              <p>The other thing is that it's quite confusing as there is no real industry standard. Taking the example of carbon emissions, there isn't one right way to measure them. So many can find it quite difficult to decide how they should measure as everyone's doing it differently. </p>

              <p>I think that would be an absolute game changer if there could be a B Corp-like version of carbon emissions that sets out the steps and aspects which should be assessed. That would help businesses out a lot.‚Äù</p>

              <p>Alectro‚Äôs Virtual Sustainability Officer platform has been built to tackle these two issues directly: working like a full-time consultant in the background, the platform automates emission measurements, creates emission reduction actions, and engages employees without taking resources away from the business. </p>

              <p>Measuring with full GHG Protocol Scopes 1,2, and 3, including detailed supplier engagement, also ensures that companies are clear about what they need to measure, and how to do it. </p>

            <hr class="w-100">
