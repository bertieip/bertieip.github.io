              <p class="lead">This month we will delve into our new Climate Champion<a href="https://www.atombank.co.uk/" target="_blank">: Atom Bank.</a> </p>

              <p class="lead">We‚Äôve been working with Atom Bank for the past year during which it has pledged to make more progress in its sustainability journey by measuring its carbon footprint. </p>

              <p class="lead">  Atom Bank recently released its Carbon Report analysing its impact and the progress it has made towards reaching net zero. </p>

              <p class="lead">This blog will highlight the most important aspects of the report and give an overview of Atom Bank‚Äôs insights and actions to fight climate change.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">Who is Atom Bank?</p>

              <p>Atom Bank is the UK‚Äôs first app-based bank focusing strongly on their customers' experiences.</p>

              <p>Their app helps customers save, buy and grow for their individual purposes. </p>

              <p>Their products are designed to be simple, straightforward and therefore hassle-free for their customers. Due to the bank being online only, it does not need to pay for traditional branch expenses. As a result, is able to pass on competitive rates to its customers.</p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What was Atom‚Äôs impact?</p>

              <p>Atom Bank produced a total of 1.09 tCO2e per employee in 2021. The company had 426 full-time employees, meaning that their overall impact was 463 tCO2e.</p>

              <p>The most contributing factors towards their output were IT equipment (33%), energy used while working from home (17%), electricity purchased to run facilities (12%) and commuting (10%). For a full list of categories measured see the footnotes.</p>

              <p>A further breakdown of their emissions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Facilities: 187 tCO2e (making up 40.45% of their total)</li>
                  <li>Operations: 207 tCO2e (making up 44.75% of their total)</li>
                  <li>Transportation: 68 tCO2e (making up 14.8% of their total)</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <hr class="w-100">

              <p class="h5">What is Atom Bank doing to improve its footprint?</p>

              <p>Atom Bank is working hard with multiple actions to improve and reduce its footprint. For its short-medium plan, these include:</p>

              <p>The most contributing factors towards their output were IT equipment (33%), energy used while working from home (17%), electricity purchased to run facilities (12%) and commuting (10%). For a full list of categories measured see the footnotes.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Implementing a 4-day work week which will help cut commuting and working-from-home emissions by 20% per year. Atom Bank was one of the first companies in the UK to make this official!</li>
                  <li>Recycling and reusing their technology equipment including all of their tech hardware.</li>
                  <li>Reviewing their supply chain to make this as clean and transparent as it can. Currently, Atom Bank is reviewing this on a qualitative basis as the company aims to align all suppliers with its goals. (See notes for how this is measured).</li>
                  <li>Making electric vehicles accessible to their team by implementing a salary sacrifice scheme for employees to lease electric cars. Atom has also included electric bicycles already in their Cycle to Work scheme for employees living within a 30-minute radius of their HQ office.</li>
                  <li>Making more environmentally conscious purchasing decisions for future goods and services ensures that this will not have a negative impact on their footprint.</li>
                  <li>Running a series of employee workshops and sustainability programmes to help each individual make better and more informed decisions in the future.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>And of course making sure to keep measuring and tracking their footprint annually to keep up with their progress.</p>
