                  <p>You have been selected as the data holder for Expense Data. <p>
                  <p>The Virtual Sustainability Officer® uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to analyse company expenses, giving you the most accurate and precise carbon measurement on the market. <p>
                  <p>Because of that, the more information that is provided to the algorithm, the more granular the analysis can be.
                  <p>We’ve put together this guide to help you and your employees to input the most useful information for expenses and to ensure the best actions can be created for emission reduction suggestions.
                  <p>We use the {...} syntax to denote data inputs, for example when talking about the an Economy class or Business class flight we would denote this as {ECONOMY} or {BUSINESS}.

              <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                  <br>
                  <h6>How can I ensure the most accurate analysis of our company's emissions?</h6>
                  <p>To ensure the most accurate analysis, it's important to provide detailed and specific information for each expense. Follow the suggested entry formats for different types of expenses and include as much data as possible.</p>

                  <h6>What is the significance of using "{...}" syntax in the provided guide?</h6>
                  <p>The "{...}" syntax is used to denote data inputs. It's a placeholder that signifies where specific details, such as departure and arrival locations for flights or the type of meal, should be inserted when recording expenses.</p>

                  <h6>How should I categorize and input business travel expenses?</h6>
                  <p>Business travel expenses like Flights, Trains, Taxis, TFL, and Hotels should be categorized and input as per the suggested entry format provided in the guide for each type of travel expense.</p>

                  <h6>What should I do if I have expenses related to meals and coffee?</h6>
                  <p>Expenses related to meals and coffee should include information about the type of meal, the outlet, and the quantity. Additional details like dietary preferences can also be included to improve analysis accuracy.</p>

                  <h6>Are there specific guidelines for recording drinks expenses?</h6>
                  <p>Yes, drinks expenses should include the quantity and, if applicable, the type of drinks (e.g., beer, wine, cocktails, soft drinks). This information helps in the analysis.</p>

                  <h6>How should social events and gatherings be recorded as expenses?</h6>
                  <p>Social events should include details about what the event is, where it took place, and the number of participants. Providing relevant descriptions is important.</p>

                  <h6>What about expenses related to purchased goods and electronics?</h6>
                  <p>Electronic items should include details about the type, make, model, and count. For ad-hoc purchasing (e.g., from Amazon), include the vendor and item type, along with the quantity if applicable.</p>

                  <h6>What if I don't have the required data for expenses?</h6>
                  <p>Expense data is crucial for both analysis and traditional financial accounting. It should be available within the company, as it's necessary for accounting purposes. Without this data, the material impact of the company cannot be quantified.</p>
