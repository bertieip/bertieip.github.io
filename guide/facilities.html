              <h3 id="data-type">What to expect from the data?</h3>


                              <h6 id="update-to-2">Electricity</h6>
                              <p>Electricity is provided directly as a utility bill to the bill payer. This will come on a traditional utility bill (typically via a PDF). This bill will contain monthly usage data, the supplier, the tariff, and whether the tariff is low-carbon or not (typically referred to as renewable, green, or low-carbon).</p>
                              <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team. </p>
                              <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>

                              <h6 id="update-to-2">Heating</h6>
                              <p>Heating is provided on bills as kWh if delivered via a traditional combustion system, or by purchased heat. If the building uses an air management system, this is covered under electricity.</p>
                              <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team.</p>
                              <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>

                              <h6 id="update-to-2">Refrigerants</h6>
                              <p>Refrigerants are a very important component of facilities data as a relatively small leak of
the refrigerant can result in a large impact as the chemicals used in the systems
have potent greenhouse warming potential.</p>
                              <p>Data is usually available from the Facilities Management team as it is a legal requirement to keep a record of any f-gas leaks or top-ups, and these are reported in F-gas ledgers. </p>
                              <p>You can often find refrigerant information in F-gas reports on the building EPC page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                              <h6 id="update-to-2">Water</h6>
                              <p>Water data is usually available from the Facilities Management team on a quartely basis. Often this is delivered via a whole building so will need to be apportioned on a space share basis.</p>

                              <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                  <br>
                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if I don't know the data?</h6>
                  <p>If the data isn't available we can use benchmark data to fill in the gaps. We would expect this data to be available for most organisations.</p>

                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if we work in a co-working Space like a WeWork or similar?</h6>
                  <p>In this instance, we can speak directly to the building or facilities management through the office manager. Please put us in touch with office management.</p>

                  <h6 id="extended-license" data-provide="anchor">What if my data isn't from the 1st of the month to the end of the month?</h6>
                  <p>Billing cycles vary, but we ask you to use the data that best corresponds to the month in question. This is typically based on which month the majority of the billing cycle falls into. If the billing cycle happens to be exactly half-way through the month, please use the lower half of the bill to decide the date. </p>

                  <h6 id="extended-license" data-provide="anchor">What happens if my data is only available on a quarterly/bi-annual/annual basis?</h6>
                  <p>In this instance, we would ask you to split it by the number of months the data is for:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Quarterly: split the data by 3 and add equally into each month</li>
                      <li>Bi-annual: split the data by 6 and add equally into each month</li>
                      <li>Annual: split the data by 12 and add equally into each month</li>
                    </ul>
