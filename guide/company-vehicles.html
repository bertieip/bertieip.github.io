                  <p>
                    You have been selected as the data holder for Company Vehicles and Company Mileage. As such, we need you to complete the template we have provided.</p>
                    <p>This guide will help you to complete the data into the format needed to build this part of the company impact.
                  </p>

              <hr class="my-8">

              <h3 id="finding-data">Finding and Requesting Data</h3>
              <p>By Company Vehicles and Company Mileage, we are referring to either:
                <ol>
                  <li>Vehicles driven for operational purposes: For example, a delivery vehicle or a response vehicle</li>
                  <li>Vehicles owned by the company and provided to employees for work and personal use: For example, traditional company car used for sales and also personal use</li>

                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>We will use this data to calculate direct combusion from vehicles (Scope 1) and also the embodied emissions of the vehicle (Scope 3).
              <p>Mileage in personal cars will be calculated seperately and included in the <i>Business Travel</i> category (Scope 3). Personal vehicles do not have embodied emissions calculated as part of the company impact. </p>
              <p>As most of this data is internal, there should be no need to request external data.</p>


              <br>




                <!-- <h6 id="update-to-2">Employee Count</h6>
                <p>Electricity is provided directly as a utility bill to the bill payer. This will come on a traditional utility bill (typically via a PDF). This bill will contain monthly usage data, the supplier, the tariff, and whether the tariff is low-carbon or not (typically referred to as renewable, green, or low-carbon).</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team. </p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>


                <h6 id="update-to-2">Heating</h6>
                <p>Heating is provided on bills as kWh if delivered via a traditional combustion system, or by purchased heat. If the building uses an air management system, this is covered under electricity.</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team.</p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Refrigerants</h6>
                <p>Refrigerants are a very important component of facilities data as a relatively small leak ofthe refrigerant can result in a large impact as the chemicals used in the systemshave potent greenhouse warming potential.</p>
                <p>Data is usually available from the Facilities Management team as it is a legal requirement to keep a record of any f-gas leaks or top-ups, and these are reported in F-gas ledgers. </p>
                <p>You can often find refrigerant information in F-gas reports on the building EPC page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Water</h6>
                <p>Water data is usually available from the Facilities Management team on a quartely basis. Often this is delivered via a whole building so will need to be apportioned on a space share basis.</p>

                  <h6 id="">Vehicle Type Data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>ID (e.g reg): </b>this is simply an identifying field and allows you to track the individual vehicle
                    <li><b>Type: </b>this is the type of vehicle with options for <code>Car</code>, <code>Motorcycle</code> or <code>Van</code>
                    <li><b>Make: </b>this is the make of the vehicle, for example Ford or VW
                    <li><b>Model: </b>this is the model of the vehicle, for example Focus (for Ford) or Golf (for VW)
                    <li><b>Fuel Type: </b>this is the fuel type of the vehicle with options for <code>Petrol</code>, <code>Diesel</code>, <code>Hybrid</code>, <code>Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</code> or <code>Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV)</code>. The difference between Hydrid, PHEV, and EV is significant so please ensure these are distinguished.
                    <li><b>Start Date: </b> This is the purchase/lease start date for the vehicle.
                    <li><b>End Date: </b> This is the purchase/lease end date for the vehicle if it occured during the period of analysis. Leave blank if a current asset.
                  </ul>

                  <h6 id="">Vehicle Distance Data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Monthly/Annual: </b>Allows you to input data on an annual basis if unavailable during the year.
                    <li><b>Year Total: </b> If you select <code>Annual</code> above, then input the total distance travelled in kilometers (km) during the year. This will then populate the data automatically on a pro-rata basis monthly.
                    <li><b>Monthly Total: </b> If you have distance data on a monthly basis then you can enter this in directly. This gives the most accurate calculation of carbon impact and will allow you to analyse why some months had a bigger impact than others.
                  </ul>
