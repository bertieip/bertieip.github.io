                  <p>
                    You have been selected as the data holder for Company Events in the office. As such, we need you to complete the template we have provided.</p>
                    <p>This guide will help you to complete the data into the format needed to build this part of the company impact.
                  </p>

              <hr class="my-8">

              <h3 id="finding-data">Finding and Requesting Data</h3>
              <p>By events, we are referring to major company events such as the Christmas party, Summer Party, or Company Conferences. </p>
              <p>Individual social events such as weekly or monthly team socials will be assessed from expense data, and so you don't need to include these. </p>
              <p>As most of this data is internal, there is no need to request external data making this template quick and easy to complete. </p>


              <br>




                <!-- <h6 id="update-to-2">Employee Count</h6>
                <p>Electricity is provided directly as a utility bill to the bill payer. This will come on a traditional utility bill (typically via a PDF). This bill will contain monthly usage data, the supplier, the tariff, and whether the tariff is low-carbon or not (typically referred to as renewable, green, or low-carbon).</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team. </p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>


                <h6 id="update-to-2">Heating</h6>
                <p>Heating is provided on bills as kWh if delivered via a traditional combustion system, or by purchased heat. If the building uses an air management system, this is covered under electricity.</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team.</p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Refrigerants</h6>
                <p>Refrigerants are a very important component of facilities data as a relatively small leak ofthe refrigerant can result in a large impact as the chemicals used in the systemshave potent greenhouse warming potential.</p>
                <p>Data is usually available from the Facilities Management team as it is a legal requirement to keep a record of any f-gas leaks or top-ups, and these are reported in F-gas ledgers. </p>
                <p>You can often find refrigerant information in F-gas reports on the building EPC page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Water</h6>
                <p>Water data is usually available from the Facilities Management team on a quartely basis. Often this is delivered via a whole building so will need to be apportioned on a space share basis.</p>

                  <h4 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">Admin Data</h4>
                  <p>The orange panel on the left hand side of the sheet gives you all your admin data. </p>
                  <h5>Admin Data</h5>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Basic Data: </b>This is the company name and the period of data analysis</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h5>Progress Data</h5>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Progress: </b>here you can track the progress of the data collection</li>
                    <li><b>Completed By: </b>Once this data has been completed, add your email and completion data so that we can ask any questions upon verfication.</li>
                  </ul>

                <br>


                  <h4 id="extended-license" data-provide="anchor">Events Data</h4>
                  <p>All you need to do is fill in the yellow boxes, providing any supplementary data associated with it, and we'll do the rest.</p>

                  <p>For each Event, there are a range of data inputs required, and some are optional:

                  <h6 id="">Basic Data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Event Name: </b>this is simply an identifyer. For example, "Company Christmas party"
                    <li><b>Event Start Date: </b>this is the date of the event. For a one day event it is just the day of the event, but for multiple days it is the start date.
                    <li><b>Location: </b>this is the location of the event. It can be a restaurant name, or a place name, for example, "Beckingham Palace, London".
                    <li><b>Event Description: </b> Please give a brief description. For example: Christmas Party held in December. Event included drinks and dinner in central London.
                  </ul>

                  <h6 id="">Required Data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Attendees: </b>i.e. how many employees attended the event. Approximate numbers are ok.
                    <li><b>Meals provided per person: </b> Meals = a course. For example, if this was a 3 course dinner, then the value would be 3. If over multiple days, please sum. i.e. Monday: lunch and then a 3 course dinner = 4, and Tuesday: Breakfast = 1, then the total is 4 + 1 = 5.
                    <li><b>Drinks provided per person: </b> Drinks = standard drinks (alcoholic and soft). Please approximate the number of drinks per person on average.
                  </ul>

                  <h6 id="">Optional/If Applicable Data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Event/Entertainment provided (optional): </b>i.e. if there was a particular activity. White water rafting, or darts etc
                    <li><b>Hotel room.nights associated (if applicable): </b>This is to help us to calculate the hotel/stay impact. A room.night is measured on an individual basis. For example, 10 people staying in their own rooms for 2 nights each = 10 * 2. Likewise if 10 people are sharing 5 rooms for one night, then the room.nights = 5 * 1.
                    <li><b>Main method of transport (if applicable): </b>If transport was required and organised, please indicated this here. For example, was a coach hired for transport? Or was it all via train travel?
                  </ul>






                  </ul>

                <p>Because Events are usually organised internally, this template will hopefully be one of the simplest information inputs to complete.

                  </p>

                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if we had an event abroad?</h6>
                  <p>Please add the event as normal. We will then be able to track flights through expenses and the information you have provided. As always, the more detail given in the <code>description</code> part of the template the better!<p>
