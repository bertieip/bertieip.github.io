                  <p>
                    You have been selected as the Office Food and Drink data holder. As such, we need you to complete the template we have provided.</p>
                    <p>This guide will help you to complete the data into the format needed to build this part of the company impact.
                  </p>

              <hr class="my-8">

              <h3 id="finding-data">Finding and Requesting Data</h3>
              <p>As most information is internal, you should be able to complete the template from your own systems/knowledge, without requiring external assistance.</p>
              <p>In general, we are asking you to build a picture of your consumption rather than needing surgical precision.</p>.
              <p>That being said, often the easiest place to find this information is on receipts/invoices from supplier.</p>.

                <!-- <h6 id="update-to-2">Employee Count</h6>
                <p>Electricity is provided directly as a utility bill to the bill payer. This will come on a traditional utility bill (typically via a PDF). This bill will contain monthly usage data, the supplier, the tariff, and whether the tariff is low-carbon or not (typically referred to as renewable, green, or low-carbon).</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team. </p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>


                <h6 id="update-to-2">Heating</h6>
                <p>Heating is provided on bills as kWh if delivered via a traditional combustion system, or by purchased heat. If the building uses an air management system, this is covered under electricity.</p>
                <p>Typically, this monthly usage will be collected by the Facilities Management team in your building so that you don't have to deal with these directly. If you don't get sent this directly, you can ask your Facilities Management team.</p>
                <p>Larger offices will tend to break this down on a space basis (i.e. room or floor), and data will be available on request</p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Refrigerants</h6>
                <p>Refrigerants are a very important component of facilities data as a relatively small leak ofthe refrigerant can result in a large impact as the chemicals used in the systemshave potent greenhouse warming potential.</p>
                <p>Data is usually available from the Facilities Management team as it is a legal requirement to keep a record of any f-gas leaks or top-ups, and these are reported in F-gas ledgers. </p>
                <p>You can often find refrigerant information in F-gas reports on the building EPC page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                <h6 id="update-to-2">Water</h6>
                <p>Water data is usually available from the Facilities Management team on a quartely basis. Often this is delivered via a whole building so will need to be apportioned on a space share basis.</p>

                  <p>The locations and addresses will copy over automatically into the <code>Office Location</code> column. All you need to do is fill in the usage data and the supplementary data associated with it.</p>

                  <p>Most data should be available from knowledge and invoices</p>

                  <p>For each item type, enter the units of consumption during each month in question, for each office location. If information is unknown for any location you can select <code>Unknown? = TRUE</code> for that office location.

                  <p>For each type, you can also enter the <code>Main Supplier</code> if known. This gives us information on the status of your Environmentally Preferred Purchasing strategy. The supplier can be traditional supermarkets like Sainsburys, Tesco, and Waitrose, but might be more specific per item. For example, coffee might come from Nespresso or might come from Pact of Volcano coffee. Milk might be delivered by Milk&More, and Fruit by Oddbox, rather than a supermarket. If you have this information then you can enter it here.

                  <p>You can select the reporting unit in the <code>Functional Units</code> column.</p>

                  <p><ul>
                    <li><b>Dairy Milk:</b> The easiest way to report this is how many pints/litres are purchased monthly. This information can come from invoices if delivered, or from office knowledge if purchased locally. </li>
                    <li><b>Non-dairy Milk:</b> Like dairy milk, this is usually purchased as a litre, and should be reported monthly.</li>
                    <li><b>Coffee:</b> This should be reported in terms of total kilograms if ordered in bags/brought at the shop. Or by number of Pods if these are Nespresso pods.</li>
                    <li><b>Tea:</b> This is usually easiest to report in terms of the numners of tea bags the office goes through per month. This can also be reported in kg if desired.</li>
                    <li><b>Beer:</b> If the company provides beers in the office then you can add these here. The supplier is not as important here.</li>
                    <li><b>Soft Drinks:</b> If the company provides soft drinks in the office then you can add these here. The supplier is not as important here.</li>
                    <li><b>Fruit:</b> You can add office supplied fruit here with an approximation of pieces or portions. For example, a banana or apple is 1 piece, whereas a bunch of grapes is 1 portion. Each would be entered as a single item in the input.</li>
                    <li><b>Crisps:</b> If the comany provides bags of crisps you can enter these here. We typically refer to big sharing bags.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuts:</b> Nuts provided in the office should be reported in kilograms. Typical sharing bags from supermarkets are 300g each, so should be summed to the total mass.</li>
                    <li><b>Biscuits:</b> Biscuits provided in the office typically come in 300g packets, so should be summed to the total mass.</li>
                    <li><b>Chocolate Bars:</b> Individual chocolate bars should be reported here by their approximate count.</li>
                  </ul>

              <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                  <br>
                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if I don't know the data?</h6>
                  <p>We are trying to get an idea of consumption rather than needing a forensic examination of the food and drink you consume in the office. Therefore, you should be able to accurately estimate any data that isn't accessble.</p>
                  <p>If data really isn't available, then keep an eye on a typical week and then extrapolate for the whole year to get a good estimate from a real-world example<p>
                  <br>
                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if we're in a WeWork or similar?</h6>
                  <p>Free coffee! Nice! In this case, its best to roughly estimate how many coffees are drunk in a typical week and to then copy this across all months. The other good news is that the coffee WeWork uses is carbon-neutral - free, and guilt free!<p>
                  <br>
                  <h6 id="regular-license" data-provide="anchor">What if we buy snacks that don't fall into the categories?</h6>
                  <p>For biscuits, chocolate, nuts, fruits, and crisps, this will typically cover all office snacks. If you order snacks that don't quite fall into the category you can select the category you think suits them best, or get in touch and we'll help you to categorise them.</p>
                  <p>The same can be said for other items, so please get in touch if you need a hand!</p>
